I am an Assistant Professor of Development Economics at the [KDI School of Public Policy and Management](https://kdischool.ac.kr/). Most of my research are empirical works based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in Sub-Saharan African countries. I study topics including intimate partner violence, unconditional cash transfers, food security, agriculture, and survey methodology.

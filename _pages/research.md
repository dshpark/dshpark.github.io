	  Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a global public health challenge associated with adverse health effects and economic costs to both survivors and society, but there is limited evidence on how it can be effectively prevented or reduced. Designing and evaluating interventions targeted at IPV is challenging because the underlying factors of IPV are so intertwined that it can be explained only by a variety of sociocultural factors in addition to personal and interpersonal elements. This paper evaluates a randomized controlled trial of a multifaceted female empowerment program in Monrovia, Liberia, where the baseline IPV prevalence is particularly high. The program intervention includes intensive psychosocial therapy and vocational skills training throughout a full year. About 12 months after program completion, we find the program significantly reduced the proportion of women who experienced emotional, physical, and sexual IPV by 10-26 percentage points (from control bases of 24-62 percent). While there are multiple pathways through which IPV could be impacted, one channel is that the business training was highly effective: labor supply increased by 37 percent and expenditure by 49 percent. While one focus of the program is psychological empowerment, we find positive but statistically insignificant effects on distress and happiness indices. We also find improvements in social norms around IPV: perceived justifiability of IPV reduced by 0.3 standard deviations.

	  We use data collected from panel phone surveys to quantify the effect of market disruptions due to the COVID-19 lockdowns on food security of households in rural Liberia and Malawi. We estimate effects using two distinct empirical approaches: (a) an event study around the date of the lockdowns (March to July 2020), and (b) a difference-in-differences analysis comparing the lockdown period in 2020 to the same months in 2021, which helps us control for any seasonal effects. In both countries, market activity was severely disrupted and we observe declines in expenditures. However, we find no evidence of declines in food security.

- **"Private but Misunderstood? Evidence on Measuring Intimate Partner Violence via Self-Interviewing in Rural Liberia and Malawi"** (with [Shilpa Aggarwal](https://aggarwalshilpa.wixsite.com/home), [Dahyeon Jeong](https://dahyeonjeong.com/), [Naresh Kumar](https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/nkumar/), [Jonathan Robinson](https://people.ucsc.edu/~jmrtwo/), and [Alan Spearot](https://people.ucsc.edu/~aspearot/))

	  <summary>Abstract</summary>
	  
	  Measuring intimate partner violence (IPV) is challenging because women may under-report. We conduct a measurement experiment in rural Liberia and Malawi in which women were asked IPV questions via either self-interviewing (SI) or face-to-face interviewing (FTFI). We find that many do not understand the module: about a third incorrectly answer basic screening questions. Even among those who do "pass" screening, placebo effects of SI on innocuous questions persist. Because the probability of responding "yes" to any specific IPV question is less than 50%, such misunderstanding will tend to *increase* IPV reporting -- especially since IPV is typically reported as an index (i.e. reporting yes to at least one question). In Malawi, we find that SI dramatically increases reported IPV (the incidence of any type of IPV increases by 12-14 percentage points, on a base of 21%); in Liberia, we find a much more modest increase of 1-6 percentage points (insignificant) on a base of 41%. These increases are similar for those that pass screening, and for those that don't, suggesting either that measurement error is present even for those who pass screening, or that SI legitimately destigmatizes IPV reporting for these women. Our results suggest researchers should be cautious in using SI, since it may spuriously increase reported IPV rates.

- **"Exhaustive or Exhausting?  Evidence on Respondent Fatigue in Long Surveys"** (with [Shilpa Aggarwal](https://aggarwalshilpa.wixsite.com/home), [Dahyeon Jeong](https://dahyeonjeong.com/), [Naresh Kumar](https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/nkumar/), [Jonathan Robinson](https://people.ucsc.edu/~jmrtwo/), and [Alan Spearot](https://people.ucsc.edu/~aspearot/))

	  <summary>Abstract</summary>
	  
	  Survey fatigue is widely thought to be an impediment to the administration of long surveys, but relatively few studies have quantified its extent (until recently). In this study, we quantify the effects of survey fatigue on commonly used household outcomes such as food security, assets, expenditures, credit and savings, and shocks. This study is set in the context of a 2-3 hour long survey conducted in-person of a cash transfer experiment in rural Liberia and Malawi. For both baseline and endline surveys, we randomized the order of survey modules, generating experimental variation in the timing when respondents enter certain modules. For example, this process results in some respondents receiving the same set of modules as late as 45 minutes relative to those who receive the same modules early. 
	  We find that entering a module one hour later decreases the probability of an item being selected by 0.8-3.6 percentage points (or 6-15 percent) from the fixed list of livestock, farm assets, food and non-food items, and shocks. Similarly, we find that delaying a module by one hour decreases the reported number of village savings groups, and the number of incidences for sending and receiving transfers by 30-70 percent.
	  Because more subcategories are skipped, it is natural to expect that the total value of categories will be lower (i.e. as more food items are skipped, total food expenditures should fall). We find large effects across many outcomes. For example, placing a food expenditure module one hour later decreases the monthly expenditure by \$3.6 on a base of \$14, making respondents appear much more poor.
	  Finally, a unique feature of our paper is that we can examine how treatment effects vary with the placement of questions. In the cash transfer study, we find effects of cash on several of the categories we study here: financial and non-financial assets, and transfers. Consistent with expectations, we find that treatment effects attenuate when these outcomes are measured later in the survey.

	  <summary>Abstract</summary>
	  
	  We are evaluating the impact of two cross-cut interventions: (1) a cash transfer program implemented by the NGO GiveDirectly, and (2) a market access intervention which reduces travel costs for farmers to access agricultural inputs like fertilizer and improved seeds. The study takes place in 600 villages in Liberia and Malawi. In each country, 100 villages will receive cash transfers only, 100 will serve as control, 50 will receive both cash transfers and market access, and 50 will receive market access only. We conduct two separate analyses from this experiment. First, we evaluate the direct effect of cash transfers (controlling for market access). In particular, we conduct high-frequency phone surveys to measure the dynamic impacts of transfers, with a particular focus on food consumption and related outcomes. Second, we evaluate the effect of market access and cash, focusing primarily on agricultural technology adoption.

- **"Going the Extra Mile: Remoteness, Input Adoption, and the Role of Subsidies"** (with [Shilpa Aggarwal](https://aggarwalshilpa.wixsite.com/home), [Dahyeon Jeong](https://dahyeonjeong.com/), [Naresh Kumar](https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/nkumar/), [Jonathan Robinson](https://people.ucsc.edu/~jmrtwo/), and [Alan Spearot](https://people.ucsc.edu/~aspearot/))

	  <summary>Abstract</summary>
	  
	  Farmers in sub-Saharan Africa typically use much less than the recommended amounts of productivity-enhancing inputs like fertilizer, and this usage (and productivity) gap is even greater for those located in remote areas. We study the effect of agricultural input subsidies on input usage, and on the input usage-remoteness gradient using a unique policy experiment: the randomization of the Malawi Farm Input Subsidy Program (FISP). The subsidy is worth approximately 75% of the cost of inputs (roughly $50), but requires farmers to travel to input retailers to redeem the coupon, so that more remote farmers face higher prices. We find that the subsidy increased fertilizer use on average, but only modestly (due to high levels of input usage in the control group), and we find no lasting impact of the program. We find no remoteness gradient in take-up of subsidized fertilizer - in this context, travel costs have no deterring effect on subsidy take-up, a result which may be attributable to the size of the subsidy. We find that the subsidy completely erases the gradient of input usage with respect to remoteness: while remoteness is associated with a decline in fertilizer usage for non-beneficiaries, the gap is completely eliminated for beneficiaries. Our results suggest that subsidy programs like FISP may have a role to play in narrowing spatial inequities in developing countries.

	  We use data collected from panel phone surveys to quantify the effect of market disruptions due to the COVID-19 lockdowns on food security of households in rural Liberia and Malawi. We estimate effects using two distinct empirical approaches: (a) an event study around the date of the lockdowns (March to July 2020), and (b) a difference-in-differences analysis comparing the lockdown period in 2020 to the same months in 2021, which helps us control for any seasonal effects. In both countries, market activity was severely disrupted and we observe declines in expenditures. However, we find no evidence of declines in food security.

	  The civil war in Liberia killed around 10% of the population and displaced a majority. Even after more than 15 years of peace, the country is still suffering from the lasting impacts of its civil war, one of them being a permissive environment to violence in everyday lives. While violence against women and girls was systematically mobilized during the war, intimate partner violence (IPV) is highly prevalent in today's Liberia. To address IPV among a war-affected population, we conduct a randomized controlled trial with 1,200 disadvantaged women in Monrovia, Liberia. We evaluate the effectiveness of an unusually intensive female empowerment program that integrates psychosocial support with vocational training and business capital grants targeted towards marginalized women in slum communities.

	  We are evaluating the impact of two cross-cut interventions: (1) a cash transfer program implemented by the NGO GiveDirectly, and (2) a market access intervention which reduces travel costs for farmers to access agricultural inputs like fertilizer and improved seeds. The study takes place in 600 villages in Liberia and Malawi. In each country, 100 villages will receive cash transfers only, 100 will serve as control, 50 will receive both cash transfers and market access, and 50 will receive market access only. We conduct two separate analyses from this experiment. First, we evaluate the direct effect of cash transfers (controlling for market access). In particular, we conduct high-frequency phone surveys to measure the dynamic impacts of transfers, with a particular focus on food consumption and related outcomes. Second, we evaluate the effect of market access and cash, focusing primarily on agricultural technology adoption.
